        <h6>The Ancient Castle</h6>
        <p>Hyrule Castle is the final dungeon of Breath of the Wild. 
        Prior to the second Great Calamity, it was the government seat of Hyrule Kingdom, 
        ruled under King Rhoam. It has since served as the location where Princess Zelda has 
        kept Calamity Ganon sealed while Link was dormant under the Slumber of Restoration.</p>
